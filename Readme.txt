This is the main repository for the SPortal project.

Now i get that using github might be a new experience for us, so I went and looked at a few videos on tutorials/walkthroughs etc on youtube, theres quite a few tutorial videos out there.

Anyways, the basic idea of Git (I'll get to GitHUB in a sec, they are not the same) is that you create what is called a 'repository' on your local machine. This repository is simply a folder linked with github and simply contains all the files of any project. In our case it will be the ASP.NET project of SPortal. 

Now you will work on your project in that repository on your computer. If you make any changes, lets say changes have been made to the 'index.aspx' (Home page) file, but you are not done yet, you will only save the file in your repository. Once you are finished with all the changes, you can 'commit' your work to GitHub, and this will actually update the project hosted on the GitHub website with the latest changes.

This is nice because once you commit a change, it creates a new 'version' of the project, and automatically merge the changes you've made to the corresponding files in the updated version. You can view the changes you are about to commit, and see any changes that have been made before you get the latest version from GitHub.

As I'm also new to this, I might have some facts wrong or something, feel free to correct me where possible please. Anyways this is what I understand Git does and i think its pretty cool, and makes life a LOT easier for all of us.

Oh yeah I forgot, We can actually create documentation as we go on GitHub itself. Play around with the features a bit and get familiar with the whole process :)

Happy coding :D
